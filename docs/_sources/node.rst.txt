Node
====

In BartPy, Trees are made up of two types of Nodes:
 1. DecisionNodes - representing binary splits of feature space
 2. LeafNodes - representing the final grouping of points together

Each Node maps to a `Split` class which contains all of the information about how a `Node` relates to data
